Greetings! I'm an engineer navigating the digital landscape from my current position as systems engineer at Qualcomm, having previously charted worked at Hilabs as software engineer. My journey has been a mix of problem-solving escapades and a genuine fascination with the ever-evolving world of technology.

In the realm of digits and bytes, I find solace in the structured world of Machine Learning, Android development, and the intricacies of Edge/IOT. It's a bit like being a digital archaeologist, uncovering the mysteries buried in lines of code.

Beyond the digital frontier, I indulge in the timeless pursuit of understanding the laws that govern our universe through the pages of physics books. There's a certain poetry in the equations and theories that captivates my curious mind.

When not immersed in the theoretical, I'm hands-on with electronics, crafting and tinkering in the hopes of bridging the gap between hardware and software. It's a practical exploration that adds depth to my understanding of the technologies I work with.

Outside the realm of circuits and algorithms, you'll find me lifting weights, cycling through the concrete jungles, and, for a dash of excitement, stepping into the boxing ring as a newbie pugilist. It's my way of balancing the precision of code with the raw energy of physical pursuits.

In the vast world of data and circuits, and between the rounds in the ring, my mission is to contribute meaningfully to the technological tapestry. Whether it's fine-tuning algorithms, crafting user-friendly Android applications, or navigating the complexities of Edge/IOT, I'm fueled by a genuine passion for innovation and problem-solving.
